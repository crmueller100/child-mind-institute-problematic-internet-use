# CMI - Problematic Internet Use

This repository outlines my solution to the [Child Mind Institute - Problematic Internet Use](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/child-mind-institute-problematic-internet-use) Kaggle competition. Held from September to December 2024, the goal was to predict problematic internet usage in children based on their physical activity and fitness data.

### Motivation

This was my first foray into the world of Kaggle competitions! It provided a fantastic opportunity to apply my machine learning knowledge I studied in grad school to a real-world data set.

### Approach

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  Extensive exploration and visualization of the dataset to understand patterns and relationships.
* **Feature Engineering:** Crafted new features based on domain knowledge and insights from EDA.
* **Model Selection:** Experimented with various machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost.
* **Ensemble Methods:**  Utilized ensemble techniques (voting, stacking) to combine models and improve predictive performance.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimized model hyperparameters using cross-validation and random/grid searches.

### Results
* **Top 10% Finish:**  Secured a top 10% placement, earning my first Kaggle medal! 
* **Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK):** Achieved a final QWK score of **0.440** on the test set. (1st place solution scored 0.482)

### Key Takeaways

* Gained valuable experience in the entire machine learning pipeline, including data exploration, data cleaning, and model refinement and evaluation.
* Learned the importance of feature engineering and ensemble methods in improving predictive accuracy.

### Future Improvements

* Explore more sophisticated feature engineering techniques.
* Study my fellow competitors' notebooks. Many of the top scorers' notebooks are [publicly accessible](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/child-mind-institute-problematic-internet-use/leaderboard).
